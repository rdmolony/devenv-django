# Reproduce exit CI on failing Python tests in devenv.sh environments

I have a Django/Postgres web app that uses [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/) for its development environment.  It is failing in GitHub Actions even though all tests are passing, this repo will attempt to reproduce

---

## Installation

Install [`devenv.sh`](https://devenv.sh/getting-started) & launch via `devenv up`
